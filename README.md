## Designing Eudoxus

Eudoxus is the official interface for managing and distributing scientific books to all the greek university students. For more info about the site [here](https://eudoxus.gr/). In this exercise the purpose is to **redesign** eudoxus while focusing on 2 **main user groups**:
- Students
- Distribution points, like bookshops, libraries etc.

Any user that belongs to either group can use the interface, have personal profiles, make requests, fill-view forms and more. Anyone who hasn't made an account can only navigate the first pages and search for books, check the announcements etc. The technologies used are:
- CSS-Bootstrap
- Javascript-JQuery
- PHP (using XAMPP)
- MySQL
